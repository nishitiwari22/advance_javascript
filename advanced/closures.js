// Closures: (Rememeber's the reference)

//  Closure :Function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure. 
// Whenever function is returned, even if its vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was pointing to. 
// Its not just that function alone it returns but the entire closure and that's where it becomes interesting !!

// Things learned:
// 1. setTimeout stores the function in a different place and attached a timer to it, when the timer is finished it rejoins the call stack and executed.
// 2. Without closure the var reference gives the latest value as it does not retain the original value but rather has the reference so any update in value after timeout will be shown.
// 3. If we use let/const because they have block scope, every time a new copy of variable is attached, thus this can be done without closure

// In the above 'z' case it is smartly collected as garabge and the memeory is freed up. Why? becasue like 'x' we din't tried to get it from 'a's function or even in 'b's function and so it was never used. 


// Things learned:
// 1. An inner function can be directly called using two parenthesis ()().
// 2. Even parameters can be passed this way (Remember that the function needs to be returned to do this)
// 3. Closures can also be used for data hiding and encapsulation. So other code cannot access this value.
// 4. Unused variables are automatically deleted in High Level Programming language by garbage collector. Closures allocate a lot of memory which cannot be deleted so this acts as a disadvantage.
// 5. Some browsers now have smart garbage collectors that automatically deletes variables that are not used outside closures.
